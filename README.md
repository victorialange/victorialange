### Hi there! I'm Victoria 👋

I'm a Front-End Developer passionate about building accessible and user-friendly web applications with responsive, clean and dry code. I am also a recent https://junocollege.com/ cohort 45 web dev bootcamp grad. 

As a former competitive athlete and coach, now turned developer, I am someone who enjoys working together with other people, and thrive on finding solutions in a fast-paced and intensive team environment. From my 16 years of experience as a competitive figure skater and then coach ⛸️, I know what it takes to achieve success and be able to deliver satisfying results: Discipline, dedication, perseverance, attention to detail, but also teamwork as well as the continuous striving for improvement and growth! 👊

Outside of coding or skating, you would most likely find me at the gym 🤸‍♀️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏋️‍♀️, in the kitchen 👩‍🍳 baking my delicious (but also healthy) plant-based maple polenta banana bread 🍌🍁🌱😋, learning another language (I speak five currently) 🤓 or dancing salsa 💃

- 🔭 My current tech stack includes:
 HTML5 CSS3 SASS
JavaScript React firebase 
- 👯 I’m always looking to collaborate on React or Vanilla JS projects 🤗
- 💬 Ask me about: career transitioning, coding & women in tech, ancient Roman and Greek history 📜, vegan cooking & baking 🌱, figure skating ⛸️, health & fitness 🥗🏋️‍♀️, countries in Europe 🇪🇺, exotic fruits from South America 🥭🌎...
